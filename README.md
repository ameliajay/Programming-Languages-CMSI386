# Programming-Languages-CMSI386
*Loyola Marymount University Programming Languages class projects from Fall 2018*

## Homework 1: JavaScript
The aim of this project was to write a collection of functions in JavaScript that could illustrate a basic knowledge of the language. There are 10 functions included in this assignment, and can be found in the *src* folder in *warmup.js*. To test the code, we npm test was used in the terminal from inside the *test* folder. Descriptions of each function can be found in the comments above the code for each function.

## Homework 2: Python
The aim of this project was to write a collection of functions in Python that illustrate a basic knowledge of the language. Again, there are 10 functions included in this assignment, many of which are the same functions that were written in JavaScript. The code for these can be found in *warmup.py* and descriptions of each function can be found in the comments above them. This was a partner project; I worked with a classmate of mine, Cristalina Nguyen.

## Homework 3: Java
The aim of this project was to write two Java programs using Java streams. Although I had done most of my coding in the past in Java (data structures and algorithms classes etc.), this assignment pushed me to think differently because we were specifically told to use streams. This was a group project; I worked with Cristalina Nguyen, Chris Santander, Liam Namba, and Annie Flora.
